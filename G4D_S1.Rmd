# Challenges and Practice of Environmental Monitoring

- Monitoring: "measuring those things that change in a system over time and space" (James et. al, 2003). Monitoring entails the  __collection__ of __quantitative__ and __qualitative__ data within a specified time frame 

- Environmental monitoring is essential for __adaptive management of the different ecosystems on Earth__.  It  is challenging due to the increasing pressure human population exerts on Earth's resources

- Environmental monitoring needs __accurate__, __reliable__ and __timely information__

# Geoinformatics and Environmental Monitoring 

Geoinformatics could provide efficient methods for measuring, processing and interpreting __spatial environmental changes__

# Dimensions of space, time and scale

- Space is the boundless 3D extent in which objects and events occur and have relate position and direction

- Time is a dimension used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events and the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of changes
 
- Scale: (i) scope or extent: (ii) measurement system; (iii) map scale

# Geospatial data

- Data is any set of raw facts that have been collected and from which inferences may be drawn

- Information is __any useful data__ that satisfies some user needs.

- Geodata is __any geographically referenced data__

- Geodata quality matters

# Digital Earth concept

“I believe we need a ‘Digital Earth.’ A multi-resolution, three-dimensional representation of the planet, into which we can embed vast quantities of geo-referenced data.” (Al Gore, 1997)

# Geospatial Data Modeling

- Putting a __representation__ of the real world into a computer
- To serve a certain __goal__
- Valid within a certain __context__ according to certain __perception__ of the world
- Expressed using some kind of __schema__ or __logic__
- Implemented in a database using some language

# Spatial perception 

- Goal and context
 - Definition: What are the objects considered
 - Level of detail: What do I consider an object
 - Scales: To what detail do I need to consider these objects
 
- Discrete view and continuous view
 - one __omnipresent__ phenomena
 - several __neighbouring__ phenomena

# Spatial representation

- Continuous view -> Fields -> Location determines value
- Discrete view -> Objects ->  Boundary determines value

# [Center for International Earth Science Information Network](http://www.data4sdgs.org/partner/center-international-earth-science-information-network)

CIESIN, the Center for International Earth Science Information Network, is a research unit of the Earth Institute at Columbia University.

One of its initiatives is __The Data4SDGs Toolbox__, a set of tools, methods, and resources developed to help countries to create and implement their own  data roadmaps for sustainable development — (i.e . __disaggregated data__ )  to achieve and monitor their SDGs priorities.

# [Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research](http://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=36437)

The  **Geomatics Group** investigates the spatial-temporal dynamics of urban development processes with the focus on sustainability (e.g land use and demographic changes). Spatial analyses are carried out on different spatial scales.

# [Atlas of Sustainable Development Goals](http://datatopics.worldbank.org/sdgatlas/index.html)

This atlas presents maps, charts, and stories related to the 17 SDGs. It discusses trends, comparisons, and measurement issues using accessible and shareable data visualizations.
