## What are we trying to accomplish?

Explore how geomatics could support Sustainable Development Goals:
 
[Mapping Data from Eurostat using R](https://rpubs.com/adam_dennett/8955)

[Mapping the global potential for marine aquaculture](https://jafflerbach.github.io/spatial-analysis-R/intro_spatial_data_R.html#)

class: inverse, middle, center

# Course Overview

---
# How this class will work
========================================================
- No programming knowledge presumed

- Some GIS knowledge is preferred  

- Class attendance is mandatory

- Class will be _very_ cumulative

---

# Mechanics
========================================================
- A  weekly lecture: 
  - First half: concepts, methods, examples
  - Last half:  labs
  
- A weekly lab (DataCamp)  (25%)

- Two assignments (25%)

- Final project   (50%)
    - To pass the class,  the minimum score is 30/50
    
---

# Mechanics   
========================================================
- Weekly Lab (25%) 
  - Labs: Each DataCamp lab should be completed within one week.
  - Late completion of any lab __will reduce half percent its mark__
  
- Monthly Assignments (HW) (25%)
  - There will be <b>2</b> monthly HW 
  - HW assigned on Wednesdays, __due on Wednesdays at 2:00pm__
  - Late homework __will receive half percent of its mark__
  
- Final project (50%)
  - A report applying geomatics to  address a sustainable development issue in your region

# A fancy word for the automation of geography?

The science and technology of gathering, storing, processing, modeling, analyzing, and delivering spatially referenced information [(Natural Resources Canada)](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geomatics/10776). 

Geomatics integrates several disciplines to create an understandable picture of the physical world and our place in it:
1.  geodesy & surveying
1.  mapping
1.  remote sensing
1.  geographic information systems (GIS)
1.  global navegation satellite systems (GPS)

# Sustainable development 

"Development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs" (the Brundtland Commission, 1987)

“Sustainable development is an exceptional opportunity – economically, to build markets and create jobs; socially, to bring people in from the margins; and politically, to give every man and woman a voice, and a choice, in deciding their own future” (Kofi Annan)

Sustainable development can be understood as  a process  and as implying practical goals or desirable outcomes, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agreed in 2015.

background-image: url(https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.svg)
background-size: 250px

# Open source geospatial tools

- R & RStudio (mostly)
- QGIS,  SAGA GIS (sometimes)

---
# Interactive mapping with R

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
library(leaflet)
leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% setView(8.678254, 50.587573, zoom = 50)
```
---
# Geocoding with R

- Let's illustrate a geocoding function using OpenStreetMap Nominatim API
- We want to know location of  Berliner Platz (Giessen) and Brandenburger Tor (Berlin)

```{r geocode, include=TRUE}
source("code/geocode.R")
```
---

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, eval=require('leaflet')}
m <- leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%  # Add default OpenStreetMap map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=8.678254, lat=50.587573, popup="The Zentrum für internationale Entwicklungs- und Umweltforschung")
m  # Print the map
```

# Assignments
========================================================
1. To write a __RMarkdown__ report illustrating how to publish interactive maps using R. A couple of examples:
  - [Publishing maps to the web](https://nceas.github.io/oss-lessons/publishing-maps-to-the-web-in-r/publishing-maps-to-the-web-in-r.html)
  -[Maps in R](https://people.ohio.edu/ruhil/Rbook/maps-in-r.html)
1. To write a __RMarkdown__ report illustrating how to produce interactive charts and maps of demographic data in R 
  -  Please include the examples explained in [this paper from Kyle E. Walker (2016)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40980-016-0029-1)
  
NOTE:  Please use data sets your area of interest

---
 
# Final Project
========================================================

Write a **reproducible** paper to address and/or report any topic related to sustainable development

Some guidelines:

- focus on a single SDG goal
- look into a region or a country

A study can be truly reproducible when:

- All methods are fully reported.
- All data and files used for the analysis are (publicly) available.
- The process of analyzing raw data is well reported and preserved.
